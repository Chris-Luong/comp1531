As a university student, I want to set due dates of to-do items so that I can complete tasks on time.  
An ideal to-do list application to help me organise tasks would include the following:  
- Having all tasks listed in dot point form  
- Tasks should be able to be easily ticked off  
- User can choose between showing and not showing completed tasks
- New tasks are added with a particular date to be completed by and the level of priority  
- Frequently reappearing tasks shoiuld be saved such that they can be easily added to the list if required  
- Tasks should appear in order of priority  
- Tasks should be able to be removed from the application when completed  
- All tasks should be groups according to the output they would provide e.g. homework/assignment tasks would be grouped together in a  separate view  
- Reaching a task deadline which has not been completed should cause an alert/shift to higher priority
